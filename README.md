# Theta-Smash

Theta Smash is a platformer-fighting game, similar to games like Super Smash Bros. This is a small project that I was working on to stretch my knowledge of creating games. Right now you can run, jump, move up through platforms, land down on top of them, crouch to fall through a platform, grab a ledge, and do a basic punch attack. There are a few kinks that need to be worked out, but this is a work in progress.

To play the game, download the latest release and run the exe file. The game suppports two controllers, and you must have a controller plugged into one of the first two USB slots on you PC to control one of the characters. To move, push the left thumbstick left or right. To jump, push the left thumbstick up. To crouch, push the left thumbstick down. To attack, press A. 

To see my source code, download the folder called SmashGame and then open this in Unity. It should have the first stage as the opening scene, with all the resources I made for the game. All the code, images and animations I created myself for this game.

Features I would like to add into the game later include sound, music, a menu system to pick characters and maps, and new moves. Overall I need to continue to polish what I have, but adding these features will make this feel much more like a complete game.
