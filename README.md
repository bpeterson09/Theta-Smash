# Theta-Smash

Theta Smash is a platformer-fighting game, similar to games like Super Smash Bros. This is a small project that I was working on to stretch my knowledge of creating games. Right now you can run, jump, move up through platforms, land down on top of them, crouch to fall through a platform, grab a ledge, and do a basic punch attack. There are a few kinks that need to be worked out, but this is a work in progress.

Features I would like to add into the game later include sound, music, a menu system to pick characters and maps, and new moves. Overall I need to continue to polish what I have, but adding these features will make this feel much more like a complete game.
